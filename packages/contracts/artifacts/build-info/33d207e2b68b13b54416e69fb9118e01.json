We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction ordering also apply here. Emits an {Approval} event. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address. - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future. - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner` over the EIP712-formatted function arguments. - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}). For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section].\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol\":\"IERC20Permit\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf41ca991f30855bf80ffd11e9347856a517b977f0a6c2d52e6421a99b7840329\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b2717fd2bdac99daa960a6de500754ea1b932093c946388c381da48658234b95\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP6QVMn6UeA3ByahyJbYQr5M6coHKBKsf3ySZSfbyA8R7\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol":{"SafeERC20":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60566050600b82828239805160001a6073146043577f4e487b7100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000600052600060045260246000fd5b30600052607381538281f3fe73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212206cf88f5263029175b3545a48eae10b12554cc86876c6445b3e4e83cc514c8f4264736f6c63430008110033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x56 PUSH1 0x50 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH1 0x0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x43 JUMPI PUSH32 0x4E487B7100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH1 0x0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 PUSH13 0xF88F5263029175B3545A48EAE1 SIGNEXTEND SLT SSTORE 0x4C 0xC8 PUSH9 0x76C6445B3E4E83CC51 0x4C DUP16 TIMESTAMP PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD GT STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"707:3748:5:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212206cf88f5263029175b3545a48eae10b12554cc86876c6445b3e4e83cc514c8f4264736f6c63430008110033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 PUSH13 0xF88F5263029175B3545A48EAE1 SIGNEXTEND SLT SSTORE 0x4C 0xC8 PUSH9 0x76C6445B3E4E83CC51 0x4C DUP16 TIMESTAMP PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD GT STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"707:3748:5:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.17+commit.8df45f5f\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false).

For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`). Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is overridden; NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.\"},\"decreaseAllowance(address,uint256)\":{\"details\":\"Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.
